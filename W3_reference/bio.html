    <!-- Main Body Paragraph --->
    <p>Hello, my name is Andrew Castro! I was born and raised in Rhode Island. However, my dad is from Guatemala. My mother was born in raised and Rhode Island as well. But, her parents (my grandparents) <br>
    are from Portugual (São Miguel). Ethnically I am Portuguese, Filipino, Spanish, and "technically" Chinese. But I think that would be too distant to count at this point. As for languages- I can only <br>
    fluently speak in English. However, I can understand the majority of what my family says in Portuguese, specifically their dialect. I can fully read and write in Korean/한글, but my vocabulary and grammar <br>
    are too elementary to be considered anywhere near fluent...
    
    <br><br>I started going to New England Tech in Fall 2021 after attending CCRI for about ~2 years, and getting some cheaper community college credits... Which ended up being more expensive in the long run... <br>
    I was originally majoring in Cyber Security with a focus on Networking but I found it dreadfully boring. I love technology and the depths it can go in, but I realized it's MUCH closer to the creative side of it.<br>
    (i.e Programming)

    <br><br>Well... That's all for my bio page. Bye!
