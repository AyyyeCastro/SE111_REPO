/* ------------ Lab Prompt ------------ */ 
/* You want to develop a JavaScript program that gathers the userâ€™s hourly pay, hours worked, 
and tax rate for a two-week period. You will use the prompt() function in order to gather this information. 
Use 20% for the tax rate. */

/* There may be some excessive commenting in place for me to reference back to if I get stuck in the future. SORRY! */ 

/* Within the same video I referenced earlier, I also saw that "let" was recommended over "var" for declaring Variables. I have NOOOOOO clue the difference. I did some reading
and it had something to do with "tighter block scoping". That is currently out of my knowledge range. I APPRECIATE ANY FEEDBACK ON THIS!! If we're going over this in the future, then 
please don't worry about explaining it now.*/
